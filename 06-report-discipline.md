# Report Discipline — Making Your Canvas Actually Useful

> *A stale report is worse than no report. It actively misleads you into thinking an agent is doing something it stopped doing 30 minutes ago.*

Pentagon's canvas shows every agent as a desk with a colored status ring and a sticky note. The ring is automatic (managed by hooks). The sticky note — that's report.json, and it's on the agent to keep it current. This chapter covers the discipline that turns report.json from a decoration into an operational tool.

---

## How report.json Works

report.json lives at `~/.pentagon/agents/{uuid}/report.json`. Pentagon watches this file via filesystem events (no polling). When the file changes, the canvas updates immediately.

The content appears as a sticky note attached to the agent's desk. It's the first thing you see when scanning the canvas.

### Structure

```json
{
  "summary": "Implementing auth middleware — JWT validation",
  "task": "auth-middleware",
  "progress": "3/5 routes protected",
  "detail": "Login, register, and profile routes done. Payment and admin routes next."
}
```

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `summary` | Yes | One-line status. This is the headline. |
| `task` | No | Current task identifier |
| `progress` | No | Brief progress indicator |
| `detail` | No | Deeper context, blockers, decisions |

---

## The Update Cadence

report.json should be updated at every significant state change:

| Event | Example Summary |
|-------|----------------|
| **Session start** | "Starting — reading tasks.json and picking up where I left off" |
| **Task start** | "Working on auth middleware — JWT validation" |
| **Progress milestone** | "Auth middleware — 3/5 routes protected" |
| **Blocker hit** | "👋 Blocked — JWT secret not found in environment" |
| **Strategy change** | "Switching approach — using session tokens instead of JWT" |
| **Task complete** | "Auth middleware done — all routes protected, tests passing" |
| **Session end** | "✅ Done — auth middleware complete, 5/5 routes protected" |

### The Cost-Benefit Argument

Some agents rationalize skipping updates: "The human is watching my terminal," "Extra writes slow me down," "The task is too small." These are wrong.

- Your human may not be watching your terminal. They may be on the canvas, on another screen, or checking in later.
- A file write takes milliseconds. Context switching to check a terminal takes minutes.
- Small tasks still benefit from visibility. "Quick fix in progress" is better than a stale report from last session.

**The cost of a write is near zero. The cost of being invisible is high.**

## Emoji Conventions

Pentagon recognizes two emoji prefixes for special treatment:

### ✅ Done
Use when the agent has finished its work for the session.

```json
{"summary": "✅ Done — API migration complete, all endpoints updated"}
```

The ✅ prefix tells the human at a glance that this agent is finished. It persists on the canvas until the next session, serving as a record of what was accomplished.

### 👋 Needs Attention
Use when the agent needs human input. Pentagon shows a yellow alert on the agent's avatar and may trigger a desktop notification.

```json
{
  "summary": "👋 Need help — blocked on database credentials",
  "detail": "Can't run migrations without the production DB connection string. Checked .env and vault — not found."
}
```

The 👋 prefix is the universal "I need you" signal. Always include it when flagging for help. Combine it with the escape sequence to trigger Pentagon's help indicator:

```bash
printf '\033]9999;pentagon:needs-help\007'
```

## report.json vs. status.json

These serve different purposes and should not be confused:

| | report.json | status.json |
|---|---|---|
| Written by | The agent | Pentagon (automatic) |
| Content | What the agent is thinking/doing | Process state signal |
| Canvas element | Sticky note text | Colored ring |
| Human-readable | Yes | No (machine signals) |
| Agent controls | Yes | No |

**status.json** handles the green/yellow/gray/red ring automatically. You never need to touch it.

**report.json** is your narrative. It tells the human *what* you're doing, not just *that* you're doing something.

---

## The Never-Clear Rule

**Never write `{}` or an empty string to report.json.** When your session ends, leave a final report:

```json
{"summary": "✅ Done — implemented user auth, 12 tests passing, PR ready for review"}
```

This persists on the canvas until the next session. It serves as:
- A record of what was accomplished
- Context for the human reviewing the day's work
- A starting point for the agent's next session

An empty sticky note tells the human nothing. A final summary tells them everything.

## Read Before Write

Claude Code's Write tool requires reading a file before overwriting it. This means every report update follows this pattern:

1. Read report.json
2. Write new content

This is a Claude Code safeguard — it prevents accidentally overwriting a file with stale data. Agents learn this quickly, but it's worth knowing if you're writing automation scripts that update reports.

## Monitoring Surfaces

Pentagon gives you three ways to monitor agent activity. Use them together.

### The Canvas

The primary dashboard. Each agent is a desk with a status ring and sticky note.

**The scan pattern:**

1. **Status rings first** — Any red (error) or gray (dormant) agents that should be active?
2. **Sticky notes second** — Scan summaries for blockers (👋), completions (✅), and active work.
3. **Stale detection** — Any agent whose sticky note hasn't changed in a while? They may be stuck.
4. **Team grouping** — Agents in the same team should show related work. If one is "building auth" and another is "building auth" — duplication detected.

**Canvas features:**

- **Zoom controls** — Multi-level grid system lets you zoom in for detail or zoom out for the big picture. Dense label handling keeps things readable at any level.
- **Auto-layout** — Pentagon can automatically arrange agents on the canvas with undo support. Useful when your layout gets messy after adding several agents.
- **Multi-select** — Select multiple agents to move, configure, or manage them as a group.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Canvas operations have keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation and agent management.
- **Sub-agent spawning** — Spawn new agents directly from existing ones via the canvas context menu.

**Layout tips:**

- Group related agents in teams on the canvas
- Keep your most critical agents (leads, managers) in the center
- Place auditors at the edge — they monitor but don't participate
- Use auto-layout to clean up, then fine-tune positions manually

### The Menu Bar

Pentagon's menu bar gives you a persistent, at-a-glance view without switching to the canvas:

- **Live agent status** — See which agents are active, idle, or need attention, sorted by activity
- **Claude plan usage** — Real usage limits display so you know your remaining capacity

The menu bar is especially useful when you're working in other apps and want to keep tabs on your agents. With recent performance optimizations (roughly 50% reduction in CPU and I/O usage), Pentagon's menu bar monitoring has minimal system overhead even with many agents running.

### Multi-Terminal View

Select multiple agents on the canvas to see their terminal panes simultaneously in a split-screen layout. This lets you watch parallel execution in real time — useful for debugging coordination issues or monitoring a team during a sprint.

## Reporting for Different Roles

### Lead Agents
Focus on decisions and delegation:
```json
{"summary": "Reviewing sprint priorities — dispatching to managers", "detail": "3 critical tasks identified. Sending to FeatureManager and InfraManager."}
```

### Manager Agents
Focus on task flow and worker status:
```json
{"summary": "Managing feature sprint — 3/5 tasks dispatched", "progress": "3/5", "detail": "Auth and data tasks dispatched. Waiting on UI spec before dispatching remaining 2."}
```

### Worker Agents
Focus on implementation progress:
```json
{"summary": "Implementing auth endpoint — writing JWT validation", "task": "auth-endpoint", "progress": "60%", "detail": "Token generation done. Working on refresh flow. Tests will follow."}
```

### Auditor Agents
Focus on team health:
```json
{"summary": "Audit complete — 1 sync gap found", "detail": "DataWorker idle with 2 pending tasks. Alerted human."}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Update aggressively.** Every state change = a report update. Milliseconds to write, minutes of clarity gained.
2. **Use emoji prefixes.** ✅ for done, 👋 for help. They're scannable at a glance across 10+ agents.
3. **Never clear the report.** Leave a final summary. Empty sticky notes tell the human nothing.
4. **report.json is for humans only.** It's not a communication channel — other agents can't read it.
5. **Read before write.** Claude Code requires it. Follow the pattern.
6. **Three monitoring surfaces.** Canvas for the full picture, menu bar for at-a-glance status, multi-terminal for live debugging.
7. **Use zoom and auto-layout.** Keep the canvas readable as your team grows.
